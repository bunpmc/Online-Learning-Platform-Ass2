## Development Notes

### SignalR Implementation
The project uses a pure hub contract pattern. Business logic resides in `AdminService`, which triggers updates via `ICourseUpdateBroadcaster`. This allows for a clean separation of concerns where SignalR is strictly for real-time communication.

### Database
- Supports both SQL Server and In-Memory Database for ease of development.
- Automatically seeds categories, users, and initial courses on first run.
